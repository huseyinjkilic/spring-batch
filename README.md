For instrument1 it says mean of all the values.

I understand I will look at the database. For example for first value;

INSTRUMENT1, 23-FEB-2010, 12.21 

And let say in database there is multiplier factor forinstrument1

Ä°d	Name	Multiplier
1	INSTRUMENT1	0.5

This means I should multiply with 0.5 * 12.21.
After this, it says for instrument1 mean of all values
It means all instrument1 or all values ??

For first 3 lines, if I seperate
